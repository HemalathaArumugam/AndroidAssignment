Android Image Gallery App
This Android app is a simple image gallery that retrieves a list of images from an API and displays them in a grid using RecyclerView. It incorporates features like caching images (both in memory and on disk) to optimize performance and handle offline scenarios gracefully.

Features
Network Connectivity Check: The app checks for network availability before making API calls.
RecyclerView: Displays images in a grid layout using RecyclerView.
Image Caching:
Memory Cache: Utilizes an LruCache to cache images in memory.
Disk Cache: Saves images to internal storage for efficient retrieval and reduced data usage.
Asynchronous Image Loading: Images are loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI thread.
Placeholder Image: Displays a placeholder image when the network is not available or when image loading fails.
Error Handling: Gracefully handles network failures and other exceptions during image loading.


Libraries Used
Retrofit: For making network requests.
Kotlin Coroutines: For asynchronous programming.


How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.


Implementation Details
MainActivity: Entry point of the app. Checks network availability and fetches image data from the API.
ImageAdapter: Manages the RecyclerView and handles image loading logic using caching mechanisms.
ImageDetails: Data class representing image metadata fetched from the API.
ImageClient: Retrofit service interface for defining API endpoints.

Additional Notes
Ensure proper network permissions are added in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
Customize caching and image loading strategies based on specific project requirements.
This app serves as a foundation and can be extended with additional features like pagination, image details screen, or dynamic image resizing.
